There are so many cute fall decor pieces in all the stores this time of year; it's hard to make it out of a store without getting some sort of fall themed item. I've been to a few different stores recently and picked up some new fall pieces. We moved into our house last October, so I have a few things from last year as well that I brought over from my old house. In this post, I want to share my fall decor and how I have it styled around the house.

I'll start in the living room with the couch pillows. I love some good decorative pillows anytime of the year, but holiday themed pillows are always the best.

[![pillows1]({{ page.pillows1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.pillows1 | relative_url }})

- Pumpkin Pillows – Michaels (2016)
- Give Thanks Pillow – Kirklands (2017)
- Pumpkin Spice Pillow – Kirklands (2017) saw it at At Home as well
- Cat Pillow – Pier One (2017)

[![pillows2]({{ page.pillows2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.pillows2 | relative_url }})

[![pillows3]({{ page.pillows3 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.pillows3 | relative_url }})

My favorite one for fall has to be the 'give thanks' pillow because the orange color is so pretty and really pops against the blue pillow on our loveseat.

On our coffee table, I removed some little succulent plants I had and replaced them with pumpkins. This is exaclty what I did last year for our coffee table with the exception of two new pumpkins I added to my collection this year. I love grouping together a bunch of pumpkins with different textures and heights. I think it makes a nice little centerpiece without taking up a lot of space.

[![coffeetable1]({{ page.coffeetable1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.coffeetable1 | relative_url }})

These pumpkins are a mix between Walmart and Dollar Tree, with the exception of the one on the far left. I don't remember where I got that one from. I also added these pumpkin "coasters" (which are actually candle lids from last year's Bath and Body Works fall collection) on top of our actual coasters. I just think they're cute, but because of their raised design, they don't work well as actual coasters.

[![coffeetable2]({{ page.coffeetable2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.coffeetable2 | relative_url }})

Next, we have the sofa table in our entryway. If you read my [Patriotic Summer Decor](http://cadygorbet.com/content/posts/Patriotic_Summer_Decor/Patriotic_Summer_Decor.php){:target="_blank"} post, you may remember the wooden stars I had on the sofa table. I mentioned how much I liked them and would love something similar in a pumpkin shape for fall. Well, I found some wooden pumpkins at Michaels this year and knew that they would work perfectly on the sofa table.

[![sofatable1]({{ page.sofatable1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.sofatable1 | relative_url }})

I got two small and one large wooden pumpkin. I paired those with a little woodland fox (Michaels) and an autumnal glass jar. The jar was just a repurposed candle jar. I filled it with mini pinecones and sparkly acorns. I also added a leaf print ribbon around the bottom, which I got at Michaels last year during their fall clearance.

[![sofatable2]({{ page.sofatable2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.sofatable2 | relative_url }})

[![sofatable3]({{ page.sofatable3 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.sofatable3 | relative_url }})

On the other side of the living room is the fireplace, which has some of the cutest pieces in my opinion.

[![fireplace1]({{ page.fireplace1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.fireplace1 | relative_url }})

[![fireplace2]({{ page.fireplace2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.fireplace2 | relative_url }})

- Pumpkins – Michaels (2016)
- Welcome Sign – Michaels (2017)

[![fireplace3]({{ page.fireplace3 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.fireplace3 | relative_url }})

- Orange Pumpkin – Michaels (2017)
- Brown Pumpkin – Dollar Tree (2017)
- Basket, Pinecones, Lights – Michaels (2017)
- Lantern – my brother gave it to me; I keep it out all year

[![fireplace4]({{ page.fireplace4 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.fireplace4 | relative_url }})

The basket was inspired by a [pin on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/415034921901498567/){:target="_blank"} that I liked of a basket of pinecones with Christmas lights weaved throughout. The lights I decided to use are battery operated and are really cool because they're shaped like leaves. You can't really notice them during the day, but in the evening when they're lit up it looks so cozy.

- Acorn Garland – Target (2017)

[![mantle1]({{ page.mantle1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.mantle1 | relative_url }})

- Whtie Pumpkin – Dollar Tree (2017)
- Home Sweet Home Sign – Michaels (2017)
- Monogrammed Pumpkin – Kirklands (2017)

Michaels has really adorable wooden signs for autumn for only $5. I liked this one shaped like a mason jar. I think it's cute and different, and I love the twine and leaf tag detail.

[![mantle2]({{ page.mantle2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.mantle2 | relative_url }})

- Owl – is actually a Christmas ornament I received as a gift

[![mantle3]({{ page.mantle3 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.mantle3 | relative_url }})

Moving on to the dining room, the kitchen table is pretty simple with just some fall placemats and a centerpiece.

[![kitchentable1]({{ page.kitchentable1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.kitchentable1 | relative_url }})

- Placemats – Marshalls (2017)

[![kitchentable2]({{ page.kitchentable2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.kitchentable2 | relative_url }})

The centerpiece is kind of a DIY. Michaels sells foam pumpkins, and this year they have some with the top cut out. They had pictures on the display showing them used to hold flowers or as trick-or-treat bags (they also have a handle). I decided to get a white one and add flowers to use as my table centerpiece. I used some floral foam on the inside for stability and stuck in some fall flowers (Michaels). I honestly wasn't too keen on it at first, but it's grown on me.

Also in the dining room is our buffet table/wine rack

[![buffettable1]({{ page.buffettable1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.buffettable1 | relative_url }})

- Thankful Sign – Home Goods (2017)

[![buffettable2]({{ page.buffettable2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.buffettable2 | relative_url }})

In the glass bowl is a mixture of a pack of autumnal decorative filler from Kirklands, some acorns from Michaels, and corn picks from Hobby Lobby.

[![buffettable3]({{ page.buffettable3 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.buffettable3 | relative_url }})

- Wagon – Michaels (2017)
- Apples – Home Goods (2017)
- Woodland Fox – Michaels (2017)

This wagon is something that I passed in Michaels several times before finally deciding to purchase it. I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, but I'm so glad I ended up getting it. I origianlly had apples and pumpkins it in, but I decided to just go with the apples because I have pumpkins everywhere else in the house. Apples are very autumnal, but I never had any apples out for decor. The wagon gave me the perfect place for them, and I love how it looks!

We have a window in our kitchen that overlooks the living room. I don't like to crowd the space up there, but I do like to put little decor pieces in the corners. I had some succulents on there, but I changed them out to pumpkins for fall.

[![kitchenwindow2]({{ page.kitchenwindow2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.kitchenwindow2 | relative_url }})

- Orange Pumpkin – Walmart (2016)
- Gold Pumpkin – Dollar Tree (2017)

[![kitchenwindow1]({{ page.kitchenwindow1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.kitchenwindow1 | relative_url }})

These metallic pumpkins are from the Dollar Tree. I was so excited when I saw them, because they look really nice and high quality, but they were $1 each! I was actually really surprised by the quality of the fall pumpkins this year at Dollar Tree. I made a post on my blog [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harborandspruce/){:target="_blank"} back at the beginning of August, when Dollar Tree was putting out there fall decor, talking about how amazing their pumpkins were this year. I actually went back the next day to get a pumpkin for my cousins and aunts, and the shelf was almost cleared out. The Dollar Tree is always getting different stuff, and seasonal items can sell out quick, so I reccommend checking them out once every week or two to see what they have. I also know that not all stores carry the same items, so sometimes you just have to get lucky.

I don't do much decorating in my kitchen, but I do like changing the towels as a way to add a little something seasonal.

[![kitchentowel]({{ page.kitchentowel | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.kitchentowel | relative_url }})

I always find the best kitchen towles (seasonal or everyday) at Home Goods. This set was purchased at Marshalls, but I saw the same ones at Home Goods. TJ Maxx also had a lot of the same fall and Halloween towels as well, so any of those three stores should have some cute ones if you're intersted.

Heading outside, I have a few things on our back deck.

[![backporch1]({{ page.backporch1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.backporch1 | relative_url }})

- Welcome Sign – Big Lots (2017)
- Welcome Mat – Michaels (2017)
- Hedgehog Sign – Walmart (2017)
- Potted Plant – Walmart (2017)

[![backporch2]({{ page.backporch2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.backporch2 | relative_url }})

[![backporch3]({{ page.backporch3 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.backporch3 | relative_url }})

[![backporch4]({{ page.backporch4 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.backporch4 | relative_url }})

[![backporch5]({{ page.backporch5 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.backporch5 | relative_url }})

I have two planters in our sitting area on our deck. I switched out the faux tulips in them for a faux fall flower mix from Walmart and added a little scarecrow to each of them.

On the front porch I have a few things, including some DIYs.

[![frontporch1]({{ page.frontporch1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.frontporch1 | relative_url }})

- Pumpkin Welcome Sign – Michaels (2017)
- Hello Mat – And That! (Spring 2017)
- Hydrangea Wreath – DIY
- Flowers – Walmart (2017)
- Harvest Sign – DIY

I have two blog posts which show step by step how I made my [DIY Hydrangea Wreath](http://cadygorbet.com/content/posts/DIY_Hydrangea_Wreath/DIY_Hydrangea_Wreath.php){:target="_blank"} and the [DIY Autumnal Porch Sign](http://cadygorbet.com/content/posts/DIY_Autumnal_Porch_Sign/DIY_Autumnal_Porch_Sign.php){:target="_blank"} if you'd like to make your own.

[![frontporch2]({{ page.frontporch2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.frontporch2 | relative_url }})

[![frontporch3]({{ page.frontporch3 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.frontporch3 | relative_url }})

I changed my summer wreath and flowers out for a red, orange, and yellow color scheme for fall. I really love these flowers I found at Walmart. They're the perfect blend of colors. I also love bouquets that have different flowers in them for bigger arrangement like this because it breaks up the texture and color without having to buy a bunch of different stems. I used about 5-6 bundles in each pot.

[![walkway2]({{ page.walkway2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.walkway2 | relative_url }})

At the bottom of our front steps, I have this pumpkin stack from Marshalls (2017). I really like this because it has jack-o-lantern faces on the front, but the back is plain. So I have the back turned out for fall, and when it gets closer to Halloween I can turn it around and have jack-o-lantern decor using the same piece.

[![walkway1]({{ page.walkway1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.walkway1 | relative_url }})

Lining the walkway are these metal pumpkin stakes. I purchased these from At Home this year (2017).

Prior to us moving in, our front yard had a nicely landscaped island. When I saw it, I thought it would be perfect for flowers in the spring and summer, but for fall I could use the space for a little pumpkin patch. I wanted to do this last year, but we moved in at the end of October, and it seemed too late in the season to invest in creating a pumpkin patch. Plus we had a million other more important things to get for the house before worring about fall decor. But this year I finally got my patch!

[![yard1]({{ page.yard1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.yard1 | relative_url }})

- Scarecrows – Michaels (2017)
- Straw Bales (2 large, 3 small) – Michaels (2017)
- Welcome Sign – Michaels (2017)
- (barely visible) Metal Corn Stakes – At Home (2017)
- Pumpkins – real pumpkins from Walmart

[![yard2]({{ page.yard2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.yard2 | relative_url }})

I think the mini pumpkin patch turned out darling, and I'm really lucky that we already had a great space to work with. It's also a nice place to take some autumnal pictures!

Wrapping up on the fall home decor, I wanted to mention one more thing. Autumn is a great time for scents, so I wanted to include them in this post. I love Bath and Body Works, and when I get their coupons for a free item or $10 off, I like to get their seasonal wallflower plugs. I actually have quite a few of them throughout our home, but I only change the one in the living room and the back hallway for holidays since they're the ones people will see the most.

[![plugin1]({{ page.plugin1 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.plugin1 | relative_url }})

This pumpkin plug is from their 2016 fall collection, but they have a very similar one out this year. It's just a simple pumpkin, but it has the night light feature, which I like for our hallway.

[![plugin2]({{ page.plugin2 | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.plugin2 | relative_url }})

This one is my new plug for 2017. They have some really cute ones, but most of them had a night light, which I only like in certain areas of the house. So I got the 'give thanks' plug, sans light, for the living room. They both have one of my favorite scents for fall, which is Marshmallow Fireside.

I also have a few candles and candle holders from Bath and Body Works as well.

[![candle]({{ page.candle | relative_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}]({{ page.candle | relative_url }})

This holder is from this year (2017), and I love the glitter on the pumpkins. Although, I'm not crazy about the pedestal. I'd rather it be flat on the table, but most of their candle holders seem to be in the pedestal style. The candle I'm burning in it is Pumpkin Cupcake, which is a mix between a sweet vanilla scent and a spicy cinnamon pumpkin scent. The scent mixed with all the fall decor pieces throughout the house definitely puts you in the cozy autumn spirit.

That's it for my 2017 fall home decor. I hope you got some enjoyment or inspiration from this post. I'll be posting a Halloween decor blog post shortly, so look out for that one coming soon. Happy Fall!
