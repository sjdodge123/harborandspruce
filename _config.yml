# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# The URL for the staticman API bridge endpoint
# You will want to modify some of the values:
#  ${github-username}: the username of the account with which you publish your blog
#  ${blog-repo}: the name of your blog repository in github
#  master: this the branch out of which your blog is published, often master or gh-pages
#  ${bridge_app_name}: the name you chose in Heroku for your bridge API
#  comments: the so-called property, this defines the key in staticman.yml where the configuration is found
